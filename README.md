# SOS2ExpSpinalEngines

Built versus SOS2 Experimental V101 (https://github.com/SonicTHI/SaveOurShip2Experimental). Previous versions absolutely will not work due to namechanges/shipcache changes.

Balance thoughts: The addition of "EngineMass" in SOS2 complicated this. Currently in testing, accounting for the needed extra plating, etc, a 5-amp engine (adding the amps/cap to the engine mass, but at 66%) will provide a hair more total thrust-weight than 2 nukes. Depends a little on ship size, however. Around 10 amps, the space of three nukes (Ignoring plumes, and capacitor, due to more placement restrictions on amps), in some testing you're still spending around 45% more spacercomps per T:W ratio (Adding the weird enginemass means I can't directly compare thrust anymore), but you're starting to save space (something like 2% more T:W per tile used)
