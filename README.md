# SOS2ExpSpinalEngines

Built versus SOS2 for 1.5 only. Previous versions absolutely will not work due to namechanges/shipcache changes. Thanks to Thain for providing some non-jank art for me to use! Anything cool looking is for sure Thains fault, any weird gfx glitches are my failures to implement it. 

Balance thoughts: The addition of "EngineMass" in SOS2 complicated this. Currently in testing, I made an overcomplicated spreadsheet. Since a regular fuel support slice supports 3 engine accelerators, around 9 (nuclear) or 12 (chemfuel) amplifiers are needed to make more total thrust/mass, accounting for plating, engineMass, etc. This means a 24 length spinal chemfuel engine the same thrust as 8 chem engines, for double the spacercomps. For nuclear, length 20 (9 accelerators) is a bit less than 3 nuclear engines, for also about twice the spacercomps.
