# SOS2ExpSpinalEngines

Built versus SOS2 Experimental V95 (https://github.com/SonicTHI/SaveOurShip2Experimental). Previous versions absolutely will not work due to a change in the shipcache.

Balance thoughts: Currently using the default amplifier multiplier, 0.25. This means the exact same space as a nuke engine, 5X5, provides 1.25 more thrust (and fuel use). Nerf to 80% so it's 1:1? Still savings from plume placement.
